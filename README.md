Identification of Strategies in Multiplayer Games Using Reinforcement Learning

This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in two-player games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Othello. By implementing RL agents using algorithms such as Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), we train agents to play these games optimally and identify strategies that human players can follow.


Project Overview


Reinforcement Learning is a trial-and-error approach where an agent learns to take actions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. In this project:

Tic-Tac-Toe and Othello environments are developed for two-player gameplay.
RL agents are trained using:
Q-Learning: A table-based method for small games like Tic-Tac-Toe.
DQN: A neural network-based approach for larger games like Othello.
The agents are compared against random players to measure their performance.
Strategies from the trained agents are identified and visualized to help human players improve gameplay.


Features


Custom Game Environments: Environments for Tic-Tac-Toe and Othello implemented from scratch.
Reinforcement Learning Agents:
Q-Learning for small state-space games.
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for complex games with larger state spaces.


Performance Analysis: Compare win rates of trained agents vs random players, random players vs trained agents, and random players vs random players
Strategy Extraction: Analyze the agent's gameplay to identify actionable strategies.
